# Refound Policy

- The entire amount will be refunded if I canâ€™t manage schedules after accepting a project.
- I accept payment by milestones, there will be no refund for milestones completed (as agreed by the client).
- If I can not finish the project within deadline, and there wasn't any explicit exception agreed by the client, the client can ask for refund of the current milestone and they can end the contract.
